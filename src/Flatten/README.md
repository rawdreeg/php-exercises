### Flatten

This exercise involves implementing a function to flatten nested arrays. The function should be able to flatten arrays of any depth, and optionally, flatten only a single level if a `shallow` flag is provided. Implement your solution in `src/Flatten/Flatten.php`.

To run the tests for this exercise, use the following command:

```bash
php test.php --filter "FlattenTest"
```
