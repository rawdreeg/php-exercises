### Invert Binary Tree

This exercise requires you to implement a function to invert a binary tree. This means swapping the left and right children for every node in the tree. Your solution should be in `src/InvertBinaryTree/InvertBinaryTree.php`.

To run the tests for this exercise, use the following command:

```bash
php test.php --filter "InvertBinaryTreeTest"
```

Inspired by Max Howell's tweet: "Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off."
