### Once

This exercise requires you to implement a `once` function. This function should take another function as an argument and return a new function. The returned function, when called multiple times, should execute the original function only once, returning the value from the first call for all subsequent calls. Implement your solution in `src/Once/Once.php`.

To run the tests for this exercise, use the following command:

```bash
php test.php --filter "OnceTest"
```
