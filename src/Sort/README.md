### Sort

This exercise requires you to implement a sorting algorithm that sorts an array of integers. You should avoid using native PHP array sort functions. Additionally, consider implementing a solution that performs better than O(n^2) for larger datasets. Implement your solution in `src/Sort/Sort.php`.

To run the tests for this exercise, use the following command:

```bash
php test.php --filter "SortTest"
```
