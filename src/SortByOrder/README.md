### Sort By Order

This exercise requires you to sort an array by moving all zero elements (both integer `0` and string `'0'`) to the end of the array, while maintaining the relative order of both the non-zero elements and the zero elements. Implement your solution in `src/SortByOrder/SortByOrder.php`.

To run the tests for this exercise, use the following command:

```bash
php test.php --filter "SortByOrderTest"
```
