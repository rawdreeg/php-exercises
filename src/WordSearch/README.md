### Word Search

This exercise involves implementing a word search algorithm. Given a 2D board of characters and a word, determine if the word exists in the grid. The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once. Implement your solution in `src/WordSearch/WordSearch.php`.

To run the tests for this exercise, use the following command:

```bash
php test.php --filter "WordSearchTest"
```
